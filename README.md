# Number Scrabble

Number Scrabble is a simple game played with the list of numbers between 1 and 9. Each player takes turns picking a number from the list. Once a number has been picked, it cannot be picked again. The objective of the game is to be the first player to pick three numbers that add up to 15.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Start with the list of numbers from 1 to 9. Each player takes turns picking one number from the list until all numbers are picked.

2. **Gameplay**: Players alternate turns, selecting one number from the list during each turn. Once a number is picked, it cannot be chosen again.

3. **Win Condition**: The first player to select three numbers that add up to exactly 15 wins the game.

4. **Draw Condition**: If all the numbers are used and no player achieves the sum of 15, the game ends in a draw.
